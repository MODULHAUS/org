To serve our own purpose, Modulhaus will do business in software architecture, design and development.  That is the primary business plan.  Fortunately, it is known to be a pretty lucrative and busy one.  A collective of active and visible members of the very art and architecture we profess should be sufficient marketing, presuming our profession is correct. In short, we barely need a business plan, we merely need to execute and take notes.

There are many challenges to be met, and a few we are acquainted with already.  They shall be seen as opportunities, for the most part.  

For instance, some known challenges present as possible business and social developments.  One such is that there are knowledge and education gaps, both within the software developing world, and at large.  Closing these gaps bring software development closer to our fold, and more developers to the work.

Inside "the tech world", many professional developers don't have time to advance their practice (in part because they are highly dependent, working class people).  This is potentially a market for manuals and publications, for niche crowd funds, and of course for direct marketing of our primary purpose.

Outside of professional web development, there are countless coders-in-waiting.  It is arguably easier to teach neophytes the new school, than convert the old guard.  Certainly the numbers favor this group.  In any case, providing education on this side of the divide is obvious, highly pontential, and an interest shared by the membership (presumably). 

As our abilities and reach increase, along with our technologies and interests, we will probably find that we can develop some services or goods.  This kind of thing will probably happen as ventures, crowd funds, and co-operative offshoots.  Nevertheless, as investments, they will inevitably serve as part of future business planning.
