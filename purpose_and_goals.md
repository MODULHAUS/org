Modulhaus was conceived as an open market for modular, open source application architecture and development.  Practically, it is the entity that will build the necessary networks, protocols, and applications to facilitate such an open market.

To do this, Modulhaus must serve as a user of the system, namely in the form of software architecture and development.  This is good user experience testing, and, according to some resources, this also the definition of a co-op:  a group of people who benefit from their own production.  It is also a means for the co-op to sustain development, and for it's members to continue their current work, which is essential to development of the system, and the architecture.  

If the previous can be called the purpose, then the following are goals that will help fulfill that purpose.  These goals will enable the co-operative as a group, and it's member's individually.  Some goals:

* provide base income for all members
* support members in their developments, technical, social and financial
* support the development of member interested technologies
* produce technical and educational materials for related practices and applications
* produce and market goods and/or services from member/collective developments
